# Magento 2 Redirect the customer to a custom page after logging in
By default, Magento 2 provides us with a feature, that allows redirecting the customer to account dashboard after logging in, you can enable this feature by going to Stores → Settings → Configuration → Customers → Customer Configuration → Login Options

Set the field named "Redirect Customer to Account Dashboard after Logging in" to Yes

This feature is working perfectly, however, Magento 2 doesn't support to redirect the customer to a particular page after logging in.

# Test the results
Go to the Magento Admin Panel → Stores → Settings → Configuration → Customers → Customer Configuration → Login Options
Set the custom page.
